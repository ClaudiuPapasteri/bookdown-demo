This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 
It is meant to be a template for future reports. 

The .pdf rendered version can be found at https://github.com/ClaudiuPapasteri/bookdown-demo/blob/master/docs/bookdown-demo.pdf

A preview of this template in .html format can be found at https://claudiupapasteri.github.io/bookdown-demo/
